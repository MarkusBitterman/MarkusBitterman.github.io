## Welcome to the Playground! 🎮

This is where I share **experiments, demos, and interactive projects** — things I'm building to learn, explore, or just have fun with.

The playground is all about:
- **Trying new ideas** without the pressure of perfection
- **Learning by doing** and sharing the results
- **Interactive demos** that you can actually use and explore
- **Code you can inspect** and learn from

## Current Experiments

### 🧾 This Site Itself
The site you're on right now is a living playground experiment! It's a real-world demo of:
- Eleventy static site generation
- Nunjucks templating
- Bulma component styling
- Sass customization
- Markdown-first content workflow

**Explore**: Every page on this site  
**Source**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/MarkusBitterman/MarkusBitterman.github.io)

### 📦 More Coming Soon...

I'm working on adding more interactive demos and experiments here. Ideas include:
- CSS/Sass experiments
- JavaScript mini-apps
- Data visualizations
- UI component showcases
- Performance optimization demos

Check back soon, or [watch the repo](https://github.com/MarkusBitterman/MarkusBitterman.github.io) for updates!

## The Playground Philosophy 🎨

### It's Okay to Be Messy
Not everything here will be polished. Some experiments work better than others. That's the point — **showing the process, not just the final product**.

### It's Okay to Break Things
The playground is a safe space to try things that might not work. If something breaks, that's a learning opportunity!

### It's All Open Source
Every experiment here is inspectable. View the source, fork it, remix it, make it your own.

## Want to Play Along? 🤝

All the code for these experiments is in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MarkusBitterman/MarkusBitterman.github.io). Feel free to:
- Clone the repo and try things locally
- Open issues with ideas or questions
- Submit PRs with your own experiments
- Fork it and create your own playground

## Playground vs. Sandbox 🛝 ⛱️

**Playground** (here): Experiments that are somewhat polished and ready to share

**[Sandbox](/sandbox/)**: The messier, more experimental stuff — works-in-progress and rough ideas

Think of the playground as "alpha/beta quality" and the sandbox as "pre-alpha". Both are worth exploring!

*Check back regularly — new experiments are added as they're ready!*
