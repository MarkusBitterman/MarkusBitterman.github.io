## Hello, I'm Markus! 👋

I'm a developer who loves building things, learning in public, and sharing what I discover along the way.

### What I Do 💻

- **Code & Build**: Creating web applications, tools, and experiments
- **Write & Share**: Documenting my journey through blog posts and devlogs
- **Learn & Explore**: Always trying new technologies and approaches
- **Remix & Create**: Taking inspiration from great ideas and making them my own

### My Stack 🧰

This site itself showcases some of my favorite tools:

- **Eleventy (11ty)** - Static site generation that just works
- **Nunjucks** - Clean, powerful templating
- **Bulma** - CSS framework that's both elegant and practical
- **Sass** - Styling with superpowers
- **Markdown** - Writing content the simple way
- **Git & GitHub** - Version control and deployment

But I'm always learning more! Check my [Now page](/now/) to see what I'm currently exploring.

### Dev Environment 🛠️

- **Editor**: VS Code OSS
- **OS**: NixOS (the new best friend ❄️)
- **Philosophy**: Keep it simple, keep it inspectable, keep it fun

### Why This Site Exists 🎯

This site serves multiple purposes:

1. **Portfolio**: Showcase my work and projects
2. **Blog/Devlog**: Share thoughts, tutorials, and progress updates
3. **Learning Tool**: Document what I'm learning as I learn it
4. **Starter Kit**: Provide a real, working example others can learn from and fork
5. **Digital Home**: A living space on the web that evolves with me

### The "Finger File" Tradition 🫰💢👉

This site is inspired by the classic Unix `finger` protocol from the 90s. Developers like John Carmack would maintain a `.plan` file — a simple text document showing what they were working on. It was personal, direct, and authentic.

This site carries that spirit forward: **a personal status file for the modern web**.
