## Welcome to the Sandbox! 🏖️

This is the **experimental zone** where ideas are rough, code is messy, and things might not work perfectly (or at all).

The sandbox is for:
- **Early-stage experiments** that aren't ready for the playground
- **Work-in-progress ideas** that need time to develop
- **Half-baked concepts** that might lead somewhere interesting
- **Learning exercises** where the process matters more than the result

---

## ⚠️ Here Be Dragons

**Warning**: Things in the sandbox are:
- 🚧 Under construction
- 🐛 Potentially buggy
- 📝 Lightly documented (if at all)
- 🎲 Subject to change without notice
- 💥 Might break or disappear

If you're looking for polished demos, check out the [Playground](/playground/) instead.

## Current Sandbox Projects

### 🏗️ Everything is a Work in Progress

Right now, the sandbox is mostly empty — but that will change as I start new experiments and explorations.

Ideas on the horizon:
- Testing new Bulma component combinations
- Experimenting with different layout patterns
- Trying out new JavaScript techniques
- Prototyping content structures
- Testing build optimizations

## The Sandbox Philosophy 💭

### Embrace the Mess
The sandbox is intentionally messy. Not every idea needs to be polished before sharing it.

### Fail Fast, Learn Faster
Some of the best learning happens when things don't work. The sandbox is where we figure out what doesn't work so we can find what does.

### Show Your Work
Even unfinished work has value. Seeing the process can teach others (and future you) more than seeing the final product.

## Sandbox → Playground → Portfolio

Projects typically follow this path:
1. **Sandbox**: Rough experiment, early prototype
2. **Playground**: Cleaned up, more polished, ready to share
3. **Portfolio**: Production-ready, well-documented, complete

But not everything needs to graduate! Some things are perfectly happy living in the sandbox.

## Contributing to the Sandbox 🤝

Want to add your own experiments? The sandbox welcomes contributions!

1. Fork the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MarkusBitterman/MarkusBitterman.github.io)
2. Add your experiment to the `src/sandbox/` folder
3. Submit a PR with a brief description

No judgment, no pressure — just experimentation and learning.

## Playground vs. Sandbox 🛝 ⛱️

**[Playground](/playground/)**: Experiments that are somewhat polished and ready to share

**Sandbox** (here): The messier, more experimental stuff — works-in-progress and rough ideas

Both have value. Both are worth exploring. Choose your adventure!

*The sandbox is updated sporadically as new experiments emerge. Check back to see what's brewing!*
