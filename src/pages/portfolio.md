## Open Source Philosophy 🌟

I believe in:
- **Learning in public** - Sharing the journey, not just the destination
- **Building in the open** - Making code inspectable and forkable
- **Documentation by example** - Real projects are better teachers than tutorials
- **Community over competition** - We all rise together
