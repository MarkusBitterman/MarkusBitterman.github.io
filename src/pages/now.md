## 🚀 Current Projects

### Building This Site
I'm actively developing this GitHub Pages site as a living portfolio, blog, devlog, and starter kit. It's built with Eleventy, Bulma, and Sass — and designed to be easily cloned and customized by others.

**Status**: In active development  
**Next steps**: 
- Adding more blog posts and devlog entries
- Expanding the playground with interactive demos
- Creating more comprehensive documentation

---

## 📚 Learning & Exploring

### NixOS
Diving deep into NixOS as my new development environment. The declarative configuration and reproducibility are game-changers.

### Eleventy Ecosystem
Exploring the full capabilities of 11ty, Nunjucks templating, and static site generation patterns.

### Bulma & Modern CSS
Getting reacquainted with Bulma's component system and exploring Sass customization patterns.

## 📝 Writing & Documenting

- Maintaining this site as a "living finger file" in the classic Unix tradition
- Writing devlog entries about the site-building process
- Creating documentation that teaches by example

---

## 🎯 Goals

### Short-term
- ✅ Get the basic site structure up and running
- ✅ Create initial pages (Home, About, Portfolio, Now)
- ⏳ Write 3-5 initial blog/devlog posts
- ⏳ Add example playground projects

### Medium-term
- Set up automated GitHub Actions for deployment
- Create a comprehensive "clone and customize" guide
- Build out the playground with interactive demos
- Develop a consistent content publishing workflow

### Long-term
- Make this site the go-to example for "simple but smart" GitHub Pages sites
- Build a community around the starter kit
- Continuously learn and share in public

## 💭 What's on My Mind

The "finger file" tradition from the 90s is something I think about a lot. Developers like John Carmack would maintain simple text files showing what they were working on — transparent, authentic, and direct.

This /now page (and this entire site) is my modern take on that idea: **a living status file that anyone can inspect, fork, and make their own**.
