## Hello and Welcome! 👋

I'm excited to launch this new version of my GitHub Pages site! After much planning (perhaps *too much* planning 😅), it's finally live.

## What This Site Is 🎯

This site is designed to be multiple things at once:

- **A Portfolio** 🏪 - Showcasing my projects and work
- **A Blog** 📰 - Sharing thoughts and tutorials  
- **A Devlog** 🧑🏻‍💻 - Documenting my development journey
- **A Playground** 🛝 - Experimenting with new ideas
- **A Starter Kit** 📺 - A real example you can clone and customize

But most importantly, it's a **living site you can inspect directly in the repo**. Everything is visible, understandable, and forkable.

## The Stack 🧬

I chose this technology stack after careful consideration:

- **[Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/)** - Static site generator that's fast, flexible, and fun
- **[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)** - Powerful templating language
- **[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)** - Modern CSS framework with great components
- **[Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)** - CSS preprocessing for easy customization
- **[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)** - Simple content writing

This combination hits the sweet spot: **modern structure, minimal fuss, maximum inspectability**.

## The "Finger File" Tradition 🫰💢👉

This site is inspired by the classic Unix `.plan` file tradition from the 90s. Developers would maintain a simple text file showing what they were working on — transparent, direct, and authentic.

Famous developers like John Carmack used finger files to share their progress on groundbreaking projects. It was a beautiful example of "working in public" before that term even existed.

This site is my modern take on that tradition: **a personal status file for the web**.

## The "Clone and Roll Your Own" Philosophy 📺

A major design goal is making this repo itself the starter kit. You should be able to:

1. Clone this repository
2. Edit the Markdown files
3. Customize the styling
4. Push your changes
5. Have your own site live on GitHub Pages

**No hidden magic. No complex setup. Just git, Markdown, and some CSS.**

## What's Next? 🚀

In the coming weeks, I'll be:

- Adding more blog posts and devlog entries
- Building out the portfolio with project showcases
- Creating playground experiments and demos
- Writing comprehensive documentation
- Sharing the journey along the way

## Join Me! 🤝

Want to build your own version? The entire site is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/MarkusBitterman/MarkusBitterman.github.io).

Clone it, fork it, customize it, make it yours!

*This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more!*
