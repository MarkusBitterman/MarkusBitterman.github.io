## A Brief History of the .plan File 📜

In the 1990s, before social media and modern status updates, Unix systems had a simple but powerful feature: the **finger protocol**.

### What Was Finger?

The `finger` command let you query information about users on a system:

```bash
$ finger jcarmack
Login: jcarmack          Name: John Carmack
Directory: /home/jcarmack    Shell: /bin/bash
Plan:
[contents of .plan file would appear here]
```

Users could create a `.plan` file in their home directory — a simple text file showing what they were working on.

## John Carmack's .plan Files 🎮

One of the most famous users of `.plan` files was **John Carmack**, co-founder of id Software and lead programmer of games like Doom and Quake.

Carmack's .plan updates became legendary in the gaming community. He would share:

- Technical details about engine development
- Problem-solving insights
- Development progress
- Philosophical thoughts on programming

These updates were **transparent, technical, and authentic**. No marketing speak. No corporate polish. Just a developer sharing his work.

### Why They Mattered

Carmack's .plan files showed:

1. **Working in public** - Sharing both successes and struggles
2. **Technical depth** - Not dumbing things down for the audience  
3. **Regular updates** - Keeping people informed of progress
4. **Personal voice** - Writing as himself, not as a company

This was revolutionary. People could follow along with one of the most important game developers in real-time.

## The Spirit Lives On 🌱

The finger protocol is mostly obsolete now, but its spirit continues in:

### Developer Blogs & Devlogs
Modern devlogs carry forward the tradition of sharing work-in-progress, technical details, and honest reflections.

### /now Pages
The [/now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) (started by Derek Sivers) asks: "What are you focused on right now?" — a direct descendant of the .plan file concept.

### Working in Public
Developers streaming on Twitch, sharing on Twitter, writing technical blogs, and maintaining public repos — all echo the transparency of those early .plan files.

### Status Pages & Journals
Personal status pages, digital gardens, and public journals all trace their lineage back to "here's what I'm working on."

## Why This Matters Today 🎯

In an age of carefully curated social media presences, the .plan file tradition reminds us:

### Authenticity Over Polish
You don't need perfect prose or professional editing. Just share what you're actually doing.

### Process Over Product
The journey matters as much as the destination. Show the messy middle, not just the highlight reel.

### Learning in Public
When you document your learning and problem-solving, you help others facing similar challenges.

### Community Through Transparency
Sharing your work builds connections with people interested in similar things.

## This Site as a .plan File 📝

This very site is my modern interpretation of the .plan file:

- **Portfolio** - Here's what I've built
- **Blog** - Here's what I'm thinking about
- **Devlog** - Here's what I'm working on
- **Now Page** - Here's my current focus
- **Open Source** - Here's how it all works

It's designed to be:
- Transparent (inspect the repo)
- Authentic (personal voice, not corporate)
- Technical (details matter)
- Regular (updated as things evolve)

## Keeping the Tradition Alive 🔥

If you're a developer (or any kind of creator), consider:

1. **Start a /now page** - What are you focused on right now?
2. **Write devlog entries** - Share your progress and challenges
3. **Work in public** - Let people see your process
4. **Be authentic** - Write in your own voice
5. **Share the technical details** - Don't dumb it down

The world needs more .plan files, more transparency, more authentic sharing of work.
